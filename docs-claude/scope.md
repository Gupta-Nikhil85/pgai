# Project Scope: PostgREST AI Orchestration Platform (pgai)

## Project Vision
A SaaS platform that transforms PostgreSQL databases into managed, versioned REST APIs through PostgREST orchestration, with AI-assisted database view generation for enterprise teams.

## Project Goals
- Enable instant REST API creation from existing PostgreSQL databases
- Provide visual management interface for PostgREST endpoints and database views
- Implement endpoint-level API versioning system
- Deliver AI-powered database view generation capabilities
- Serve enterprise teams with streamlined database-to-API workflows

## Success Criteria
- Users can connect their PostgreSQL database and get a working REST API management dashboard within minutes
- Teams can collaboratively manage database views and API endpoints through a web interface
- API versioning system allows safe evolution of endpoints without breaking existing integrations
- AI features reduce time-to-market for new API endpoints by 70%
- Platform handles enterprise-scale databases with multiple team members

## Phase 1 Scope (Core Orchestration Platform)

### Included:
- **Connection Management**: Support for user-managed PostgREST instances via connection parameters
- **Database Schema Discovery**: Visual exploration of PostgreSQL database structure
- **View Management**: GUI for creating, editing, and managing database views
- **Endpoint Management**: Interface for configuring and testing PostgREST endpoints
- **Basic Versioning**: Endpoint-level versioning with change tracking
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user access with role-based permissions
- **API Documentation**: Automatic generation of OpenAPI specs from PostgREST endpoints

### Explicitly Excluded from Phase 1:
- PostgREST instance management/hosting
- Schema-level versioning
- Automated breaking change handling
- Migration script execution
- AI-powered view generation
- Advanced analytics and monitoring
- Enterprise SSO integration
- Advanced security policies

## Phase 2 Scope (Advanced Management)

### Included:
- **Schema Migration Tooling**: Visual migration planning and SQL script generation
- **Breaking Change Detection**: Analysis and user alerts for potentially breaking changes
- **Advanced Versioning**: Schema-level versioning capabilities
- **Performance Monitoring**: Basic query performance tracking
- **Enhanced Team Features**: Advanced role management, audit logs

## Phase 3 Scope (AI Integration)

### Included:
- **AI View Generation**: Natural language to SQL view creation
- **Migration Assistant**: AI-suggested migration scripts
- **Query Optimization**: AI-powered performance recommendations
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated API documentation with business context

## Technical Constraints

### Deployment Model:
- **SaaS Platform**: Cloud-hosted solution with multi-tenant architecture
- **User-Managed PostgREST**: Users maintain their own PostgREST instances
- **Direct Management**: No proxy layer - direct PostgREST configuration management

### Versioning Strategy:
- **Endpoint-Level**: Individual endpoint versioning in Phase 1
- **Future Schema-Level**: Architecture must support future schema versioning
- **User-Managed Migrations**: Users handle migration execution in Phase 1

### Integration Approach:
- **PostgREST Connection**: Direct connection to user's PostgREST instance for configuration
- **PostgreSQL Connection**: Direct connection to user's database for schema discovery
- **Existing Setup Support**: Ability to import and manage existing PostgREST configurations

## Target Users

### Primary: Enterprise Development Teams
- **Technical Level**: Intermediate - familiar with databases but not necessarily DBAs
- **Team Size**: 5-50 developers working with shared databases
- **Use Cases**: API development, microservices architecture, rapid prototyping
- **Pain Points**: Manual PostgREST configuration, API versioning complexity, database view management

### Secondary: Technical Product Managers
- **Technical Level**: Basic to intermediate
- **Use Cases**: API roadmap planning, understanding data relationships
- **Pain Points**: Lack of visibility into API capabilities, difficulty coordinating database changes

## Business Constraints
- **Time to Market**: Phase 1 delivery within 6 months
- **Scalability**: Must support 100+ concurrent teams from launch
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security requirements from Phase 1
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II compliance required

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 50+ enterprise teams using platform within 6 months of Phase 1 launch
- **Engagement**: Average team creates 10+ API endpoints within first month
- **Retention**: 80%+ monthly active team retention rate
- **Performance**: Platform response time <2s for all core operations
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime SLA
