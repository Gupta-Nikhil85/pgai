## Phase 1 User Stories

### Connection Management
```
As a team lead,
I want to connect my existing PostgreSQL database and PostgREST instance,
So that I can start managing my APIs through a centralized platform.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Support PostgreSQL connection via URL/credentials
- Support PostgREST connection via URL/credentials

- Test connectivity and permissions
- Store connection configurations securely
- Support multiple database/PostgREST pairs per team
```

### Database Schema Discovery
```
As a developer,
I want to visualize my database schema including tables, views, and relationships,
So that I can understand the data structure before creating APIs.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Display all tables, views, functions, and relationships
- Show column details (type, constraints, defaults)
- Provide search and filtering capabilities
- Highlight PostgREST-relevant objects
- Refresh schema on demand
- Show schema change history
```

### View Management
```
As a developer,
I want to create and manage database views through a visual interface,

- Visual query builder for basic view creation
- SQL editor with syntax highlighting for advanced views
- Preview view results before creation
- Edit existing views
- Delete views with dependency checking
- View creation templates for common patterns
```

### Endpoint Configuration
```
As a team lead,
I want to configure PostgREST endpoints with custom settings,
So that I can control API behavior and security.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Configure endpoint permissions and roles
- Set up custom headers and CORS policies
- Define request/response transformations
- Configure rate limiting and caching
- Enable/disable endpoints
- Bulk endpoint operations
```

### API Versioning
```
As a developer,
I want to version my API endpoints,
So that I can evolve APIs without breaking existing integrations.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Create endpoint versions with semantic versioning
- Compare versions side-by-side
- Mark versions as deprecated with sunset dates
- Track version usage and adoption
- Generate migration guides between versions
- Support parallel version deployment
```

### Team Collaboration
```
As a team lead,
I want to manage team access to database management features,
So that I can control who can make changes to our APIs.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Role-based access control (Admin, Developer, Viewer)
- Team invitation and management
- Activity logging and audit trails
- Change approval workflows for production
- Comment and discussion threads on changes

```

### API Documentation
```
As a product manager,
I want automatically generated API documentation,
So that I can understand and communicate API capabilities.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Generate OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Interactive API explorer and testing interface
- Custom documentation annotations
- Version-specific documentation
- Export documentation in multiple formats
